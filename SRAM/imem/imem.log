DRC/LVS/PEX is only run on the top-level design to save run-time (inline_lvsdrc=True to do inline checking).
DRC/LVS/PEX is disabled (check_lvsdrc=True to enable).
Characterization is disabled (using analytical delay models) (analytical_delay=False to simulate).
Only generating nominal corner timing.
